## App Setup 

If needed, the app is under the repository ProjetoAMSSII. Clone the project.  
  
HTTPS: ```https://github.com/JoaoBBarroso/ProjetoAMSSII.git``` 
  
SSH: ```git@github.com:JoaoBBarroso/ProjetoAMSSII.git```

### Running through Visual Studio (VS)
  
1. Latest stable and LTS version of [Node.js][1]
  
### Necessary Commands
  
Once in the app you will need to access the terminal and type the command ```npm install``` in every major directory (```cd [directory]``` for the mobile, frontend & backend directories) as this will download all the necessary node-modules for the app (mobile and web).  
  
Then, after installation all you need to do is enter the intended directory and type ```npm start``` and the app should start. If you are using the web app, be sure to also run the server (F5). 
  
**Note:** if you do not have Node or npm installed in your computer please do install them. (Node installation also installs npm) [download LTS][1].
  
### In Expo
  
For running the mobile app and using the expo development tools, please check [Expo documentation][2] on the matter.
